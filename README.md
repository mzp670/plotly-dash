## Analyzing tourism trends in New Zealand with an interactive International Visitors Dashboard

**Introduction**

New Zealand, a stunning island nation nestled in the Pacific Ocean, boasts captivating landscapes, a rich blend of cultures, and a thriving economy. With a population of 5.15 million and a robust GDP of 2.4 as of December 2022, the country is a haven for travelers seeking natural beauty, warm hospitality, and culinary delights. Tourism plays a pivotal role in this growth story, contributing a significant $10 billion to the GDP and fostering cultural exchange and commercial opportunities. This project aims to create a dashboard showcasing foreign tourism's economic impact, revealing spending patterns across locations, preferred activities, and accommodation choices, offering valuable insights for informed decision-making.


**About the Data**

Using the international visitors survey public datasets from NZ Stats, the intent is to produce a dashboard that will feature historical statistics and trends within the timeframe of year 2000 to 2020. Five references were used on this project that are related to international visitors: expenditure, main accommodation used, activities, transportation and regional spend.
